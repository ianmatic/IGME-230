#Film Stats

## How-To
Check the boxes of what kind of information you'd like to return, then type in the film title, then click search

## Process
I browsed the API list for quite some time, initially trying to use the Wegmans API (rejected unfortunately).
I then decided to use the OMDB API, which seems to essentially extract information from IMDB.
I've always had a problem with researching movies (in terms of if I should go see it), as often times I get spoilers from just looking it up.
So, I thought it would be useful to have a site that simply tells me how good the reviews are for the movie without risking spoilers.
I basically built off of the giphy homework and various web-apps homeworks for the overall structure, however I did use a few youtube tutorials to get the API working.
I also used some very light J-Query and font-awesome

## Resources
In terms of content, I created everything with the exception of the font (cited below).

## Notes
The mobile version works very well on every device I've tested, with the exception of some iPhones, which have some slight cropping issues.
I believe I met all of the requirements for the project, the site looks and operates really well, and I believe the degree of polish put into
the site (in terms of functionality and design), it goes above and beyond. Therefore, I believe I've earned a 100 on the project.

Aside from various stackoverflow pages and W3C pages, some specific sources that I used are:
