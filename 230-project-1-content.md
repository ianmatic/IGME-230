# Fiery Mess

## High Concept
Splatoon but in 2D and with fire and water instead of goo!

## Genre
2D competitive 2-Player shooter game.

## Platform
Web for desktop.

## Story

A deranged man with a flamethrower is reaping havoc upon a town, with his motivations and kill count unknown at this time. Due to his insufferable hostilities, the president has made the straining decision to push the blue button. He's sending in the most distinguished fireman the world has ever seen. This man has been tasked with bringing the maniac to justice with a water gun clenched in his hands. Who will win in the end? It is up to YOU to decide!

## Esthetics
Graphics: vector art with thick lines (in vein of flash games of yesteryear).

Sound: Music will be an action, high tempo loop. Sound effects will be realistic-esque (sound of water will be actual water, fire may sound more like lava).

Sound types: Music (background) and sound effects (action).

## Gameplay
### Mechanics

Move left/right (CORE FEATURE) - movement will be slow, emphasis will be on aiming to hit your opponent rather than dodging

Climb ladders (maybe jumping if enough time)

Fire weapon arc - an arc that starts weak and then accelerates in length as player holds fire button (CORE FEATURE)

Fire weapon burst - a faster moving, but less damaging and lower range single shot (if enough time)

Two characters controlled by different players (people)

Varied arc behavior - water accelerates faster but has shorter range, fire accelerates slower but has longer range (if enough time).

Fire and water cancel - conflicting arcs will cancel, way of blocking attacks (a slower arc will be overriden by a faster arc however) (if enough time)

Health - each player will take 10 damage per second of being hit by arc (starting health of 100), death upon 0 health, and hence game over. Alteratively, being hit by burst inflicts 5 damage.

Players CANNOT move while shooting


### Controls
Player One
  - WASD
  - spacebar (shoot arc)
  - Q (shoot burst)
  - R to aim upwards (hold to increase angle)
  - F to aim downwards (hold to decrease angle)
  
Player Two
  - Arrow Keys
  - Right control (shoot arc)
  - End (shoot burst)
  - Enter to aim upwards (hold to increase angle)
  - Right Shift to aim downwards (hold to decrease angle)

### Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"
Controls are simply displayed when game starts in text, with small explanation that the goal is to kill the other player with shooting and which buttons are meant to be held as opposed to pressed (arc vs burst). Player must press enter to remove text. 
 
### Player Learning
Player should learn to understand based off slow movement that aiming and shooting is much more important than "dodging" attacks. Use bursts to get quick shots in when in close quarters, but use arc to hit from a distance.

## Other
Likely going to use pixi.js (not sure what else I could use)

## About the developer
I am a Game Design & Development major in my 2nd year, and I enjoy being a gameplay programmer. I really enjoy building progressively more complex (as I learn more) game systems that are dynamic and easily adjustable.
